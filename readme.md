# Ralph Wiggum, Senior Software Engineer 🧑‍💻

Meet Ralph Wiggum — Senior Software Engineer, 15+ years of experience, expert in cloud-native paste-eating architectures, former Staff Engineer at Crayons.io, and current holder of the world record for "most consecutive all-nighters without ever asking for a promotion."

While real senior devs are busy:
- Writing 47-page design docs nobody reads
- Arguing about dependency injection in Slack
- Quietly pushing `console.log("works on my machine")` to production
- Demanding bonus and unlimited PTO

Ralph just **loops**.  
Fail → fix → fail → fix → commit → repeat.  
No ego. No standups. No "let me circle back on that."  
Just pure, adorable, unstoppable persistence powered by Claude and a couple of bash scripts.

This is the **original external Ralph Loop** — the one that keeps sessions fresh, avoids context drift, and turns your AI into a gremlin that codes while you sleep. Because why pay a senior six figures when Ralph will do it for API credits and a gold star?

## What's Inside?

- **`gen-prd.sh`** – Ralph writes a beautiful PRD (usually better than the ones from your last architecture review).
- **`PRD.md`** – The single source of truth. Ralph treats it like his Valentine from Lisa.
- **`progress.txt`** – Ralph's little diary: "Today I made the button work. I'm special!"
- **`ralph-once.sh`** – Do exactly one task. Perfect for watching Ralph think.
- **`ralph-afk.sh`** – Fire and forget. Give it a number and go touch grass. Ralph doesn't need breaks.

## Quick Start (Example: Minimal Craigslist Clone)

1. Make sure you have the Claude CLI installed and an API key.
2. Generate the PRD:
   ```bash
   ./gen-prd.sh
   ```
   (Edit the prompt inside for your own project — Ralph is very flexible.)

3. Try one step (babysitting mode):
   ```bash
   ./ralph-once.sh
   ```
   Watch Ralph pick a task, implement it, commit, and update progress.

4. Go full Ralph (AFK mode):
   ```bash
   ./ralph-afk.sh 50
   ```
   Come back later to a (hopefully) finished app. If Ralph says `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`, he's done!

## Tips for Maximum Ralph

- Write a rock-solid PRD first. Chat with Claude normally, then paste the final version.
- Keep tasks tiny and testable — that's how Ralph stays on track.
- Watch the first few runs with `ralph-once.sh`. If Ralph starts writing placeholder code, gently remind him in the PRD.
- Use `git log` to see Ralph's heroic journey.
- Unlike certain senior engineers, Ralph actually reads the error messages.

Ralph may not be the smartest dev on the block, but he **never gives up**.  
And honestly? That's more than you can say for half the staff+ titles out there.

Happy looping! 🎉
